  - clean up data
  - multiple file formats support
      - most of the time, we use csv
  - merge and join various dataset
  - handel missing dataoptimized performance
  - allignment and indexing
  - provides visualization
      - data visualization
      - tableau
      - power BI


pandas basci data structures, series for one dimension and DataFrame for 2 dimension and extremly useful and flexible tools

Pandas is and open source libraru for data manipulation and analyisis in Python programming language

Data structure              Dimensionality              Format
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Series                      1D                          Column
DataFrame                   3D                          Single Sheet
Panel                       2D                          Multiple Sheets

Pandas Series 
built on top of NumPy array objects and they are very similar
It is 1D labeled array that can hold data of any data type
Label values are called indexes
the data type intelf can consist of number, strings, or other Python objects
lists, ordered array or dictionaries can be used to create series

Series Index - row index
Series Name - column name
Series Values - data values

DataFrame
2d labeled data structure with rows and columns
each column in DataFrame is Panda Series
the data intels can consist of numbers, strings or other python objects
lists, ordered array or dictionaries can be used to create series
